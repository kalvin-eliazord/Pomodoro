- **Work and Break timers (Short and Long breaks)**
- **Customizable durations**
- **Task management (add, delete, and mark as done)**
- **Progress tracking with a visual bar**

## Timer Logic

The Pomodoro timer operates as follows:

1. **Work Phase:** Starts with a set duration (default: 25 minutes).
2. **Short Break:** Triggers after a completed work session (default: 5 minutes).
3. **Long Break:** Occurs after a set number of Pomodoro cycles (default: every 4 cycles, 15 minutes).
4. **Repeat:** The cycle continues until stopped manually.

| `stopButton`                                                            | Stops the timer and resets the session     |
| `progressBar`                                                           | Visual representation of remaining time    |
| `addTodoTaskInput`                                                      | Input field to add new tasks               |
| `todoTaskUl`                                                            | List of pending tasks                      |
| `doneTaskUl`                                                            | List of completed tasks                    |
| `workInput`, `shortBreakInput`, `longBreakInput`, `longBreakDelayInput` | Settings inputs for duration customization |

## Customization

To modify the Pomodoro cycle for testing, update the values in:

```js
const getTestPomodoroCycle = (longBreakDelay) => {
  const seconds = 4;
  const shortBreakSeconds = 3;
  const longBreakSeconds = 4;
  ...
};
```

Change the `seconds`, `shortBreakSeconds`, and `longBreakSeconds` values as needed.
